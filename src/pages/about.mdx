Hello, stranger~

## About Me

### Self-Introduction

A quiet coder behind the screen 
一invisible in the crowd, but present in the code. I’m an introvert with a deep interest in web development, someone who finds comfort in clean code, ambient music, and calm solitude.

I haven’t walked the conventional path. I’m self-taught, still growing, still stumbling, but fully committed to becoming better every day. I haven't yet faced all of society’s trials, but I know they're coming — and I’m preparing.

In this noisy digital world, I might just be a faint signal. But if you’ve found me, I hope you’ll notice the work I’ve put in — even if I don’t always speak loudly about it.

I like building things with code, experimenting with side projects, and learning from the ground up. I enjoy simplicity — writing code that works, listening to pure instrumental music, watching light-hearted animation, and playing games (preferably with someone — solo gaming feels too quiet).

I’m curious about many things, but I’m not a master of any — and that’s okay. I’m here to explore, create, and keep trying.
